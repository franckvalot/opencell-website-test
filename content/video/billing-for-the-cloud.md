During this 1 hour webinar that will include several detailed use cases, we will show you how Opencell can be used to perform billing of usage, subscription and one-off charges for IaaS, PaaS and SaaS cloud businesses. Youâ€™ll see how our solution gives you flexibility to bill with the granularity you need and see how it can be used with complex B2B/B2C and B2B2C hierarchies.
