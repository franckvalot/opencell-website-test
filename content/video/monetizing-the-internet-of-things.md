During this 1 hour webinar that will include several detailed use cases, we will show you how Opencell can be used to monetize sophisticated IoT businesses. Based on our experience with IoT networks and devices, we will provide you with a use case showing how our integrated mediation can be used to aggregate events and how our rating and charging capability give you the capability to implement complex business models. Weâ€™ll also show you how the power of of our multi-level customer hierarchy can be used to implement complex B2B/B2C and B2B2C hierarchies.
