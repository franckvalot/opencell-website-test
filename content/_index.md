      position: CEO @ Actility
      testimonial: >-
        Opencell provided the flexibility we needed to adapt the product billing
        features to the complex and evolving needs of a marketplace for Devices,
        Applications and Connectivity, and the related settlement
        requirements.   We intend to integrate it completely in our IaaS cloud
        to manage the complex financial flows matrix of ThingPark marketplace,
        and also make it available to our network operator partners for their
        own IoT billing & settlement needs.

      testimonial: >-
        Opencell provided a flexible billing solution that was able to respond
        to our complex multi-party billing and commissioning needs. Training
        took place in less than a week and our team was able to manage the
        implementation project internally.   Opencell has given us the ability
        to scale our business and quickly create new offers. Our cash-flow has
        improved since we’re now able to bill on a monthly instead of quarterly
        basis. We’ve also improved our revenue assurance and been able to
        reallocate the FTE saved on billing tasks to new more value-added tasks.

      position: Project Manager @ Orange
      testimonial: >-
        For the launch of the new Orange Cloud For Business platform, we were
        primarily interested in finding an open source solution that could be
        configured to model standard as well as completely customized
        subscription models. The product needed to be able to be administered by
        business analysts.   Opencell fulfilled our requirements. Missing
        functionalities identified during the proof of concept workshop were
        quickly developed and integrated into the core open source model. The
        support team was very proactive and quickly helped us to resolve all
        technical issues encountered during the implementation phase.
