      Our core platform is built around a powerful billing engine that provides
      rating, charging and invoice cycle management.

      Rating functionality covers one-off events, such as activation and
      termination charges, subscription events and usage charges. Charging can
      be done to postpaid and prepaid wallets.

      With Opencell, no need to worry about integrating a third-party mediation
      to get your billing system up and running since our mediation  is included
      right out of the box.


      You can use it to convert event datatypes (generally called CDRs or
      carrier data records) to other datatypes used for rating and billing
      purposes. It enables de-duplication, transformation and formating. CDR
      events mediated by Opencell are stored as EDRs or electronic data
      records.  


      Our mediation is  a perfect choice for telco, IoT or cloud businesses that
      need to crunch a large number of events. Our mediation is compatible with
      Diameter, the main connectivity protocol used in telco operator networks.
      It has undergone strenuous testing and has the power to process hundreds
      of record entries per second. 


      It’s also used by many of our energy and utility customers to crunch meter
      data. We’ve already developed specific mediation processes to handle the
      specificities of these businesses.

      Because Opencell is built for complex billing, we provide flexible
      features for structuring thousands of products—from simple to complex—so
      you’ll be able to successfully manage every single product, bundle,
      package and plan in your catalog.


      Using a simplified business offer model, our catalog manager lets users
      create a new offer with its services, charges, counters, price plans,
      custom fields, mediation scripts, webhooks etc. in just a few clicks.


      In the event that more complex offers need to be created, advanced
      functionalities can be used to build an offer from scratch. Our rich
      configuration possibilities mean that we can practically guarantee that
      we’ll be able to model whatever offer your product or marketing teams
      dreams up.

      Our order manager keeps customer data in sync, executes both simple and
      complex workflows and drive processes at-scale. Event notifications that
      push data-rich messages across system boundaries with APIs allow access to
      Opencell data from anywhere. 


      Workflows manage business processes with automated rules, flows, and
      forms. 

      You can measure time, disk space, bandwidth, downloads and notify a
      customer when they cross a usage threshold and offer them an upgrade. It’s
      easy to configure which services are available in a plan and implement
      automatic enablement and provisioning.


      We make it easy for business users to make changes without going through
      IT. You can trigger automated provisioning and a wide variety of other
      business functions in real time. You can alert customers about
      time-sensitive discounts, expired credit cards, or impending usage
      thresholds without building complex logic yourself.  You can schedule any
      service, process, or activity to occur at any time, based on any trigger.

      Opencell integrates a data warehouse that pre calculates data and standard
      metrics used to manage a subscription business including monthly recurring
      revenue (MRR), annual recurring revenue (ARR), churn and total contract
      value. 


      Our data warehouse can be easily connected with practically any third
      party data analytics or business intelligence package such as Qlikview or
      PowerBI.

      Revenue recognition in subscription businesses is tricky. You bill in
      advance and need to recognize revenue over time. You bill in arrears and
      need to make sure you accrue for revenue that you will bill at a later
      date.


      Opencell provides you with the forward-looking tools you need to manage
      your subscription business including possibility to apply customized
      revenue recognition rules to invoice line items.


      We also give you the ability to manage your chart of accounts and
      financial periods so you can keep your transactions in synch with your
      downstream ledgers. 


      Mapping to downstream accounting systems is easily performed on a summary
      or detailed basis using flat file exports or our rich APIs.

      Our accounts receivable module manages cash applications, payment methods,
      open balances and automatic dunning actions.


      Payments can be matched manually via GUI to corresponding payments
      operations or automatically by payment job. Connectors to main payment
      gateways are available. If your payment gateway isn’t available, our rich
      APIs make it easy for you integrate your platform of choice. 


      In the event of late payment, automatic dunning actions such as sending
      email or adding a fee can be configured. You can send notifications and
      reminders to customers through their preferred communications channels
      (including mobile devices), configure escalations in multiple stages, and
      differentiate escalation procedures based on product line, account group,
      or other factors of your choice. You can use workflows service activation
      to suspend service automatically at any stage in the escalation process,
      or continue to deliver service as long as you’d like. 


      Configurable aging reports are also provided.
