          Our core platform is built around a powerful billing engine that
          provides rating, charging and invoice cycle management. Rating
          functionality covers one-off events, such as activation and
          termination charges, subscription events and usage charges. Charging
          can be done to postpaid and prepaid wallets.

          With Opencell, no need to worry about integrating a third-party
          mediation to get your billing system up and running since our
          mediation  is included right out of the box. Our mediation is  a
          perfect choice for telco, IoT or cloud businesses that need to crunch
          a large number of events. It’s also already used by many of our energy
          and utility customers to crunch meter data. 
      - content: >-
          Our mediation converts event datatypes (generally called CDRs or
          carrier data records) to other datatypes used for rating and billing
          purposes. It enables de-duplication, transformation and formating. CDR
          events mediated by Opencell are stored as EDRs or electronic data
          records. 

           Our mediation is compatible with Diameter, the main connectivity protocol used in telco operator networks. It has undergone strenuous testing and has the power to process hundreds of record entries per second.

          Because Opencell is built for complex billing, we provide flexible
          features for structuring thousands of products—from simple to

          bundle, package and plan in your catalog.

          Using a simplified business offer model, our catalog manager lets
          users create a new offer with its services, charges, counters, price
          plans, custom fields, mediation scripts, webhooks etc. in just a few
          clicks. If more complex offers need to be created, advanced
          functionalities can be used to build an offer from scratch to model
          whatever offer your product or marketing teams dreams up.

          and services or asked to pay upon receipt.

          can set off automatic dunning processes.
