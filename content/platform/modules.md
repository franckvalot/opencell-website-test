      Our core platform is built around a powerful billing engine that provides
      rating, charging and invoice cycle management.

      Rating functionality covers one-off events, such as activation and
      termination charges, subscription events and usage charges. Charging can
      be done to postpaid and prepaid wallets.

      With Opencell, no need to worry about integrating a third-party mediation
      to get your billing system up and running since our mediation  is included
      right out of the box.


      You can use it to convert event datatypes (generally called CDRs or
      carrier data records) to other datatypes used for rating and billing
      purposes. It enables de-duplication, transformation and formating. CDR
      events mediated by Opencell are stored as EDRs or electronic data
      records.  


      Our mediation is  a perfect choice for telco, IoT or cloud businesses that
      need to crunch a large number of events. Our mediation is compatible with
      Diameter, the main connectivity protocol used in telco operator networks.
      It has undergone strenuous testing and has the power to process hundreds
      of record entries per second. 


      It’s also used by many of our energy and utility customers to crunch meter
      data. We’ve already developed specific mediation processes to handle the
      specificities of these businesses.
