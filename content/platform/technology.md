    massive scalability and reliability challenge that our enterprise-grade

      Opencell is “cloud-ready” and can be instantly deployed in a private or a
      public Cloud using Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. If you
      prefer, you can also chose to run Opencell on virtual machines for
      on-premises deployment or in a managed hosting environment
  - title: Scalability and high availability
    description: >-
      Clustering allows Opencell to run on several parallel servers. This
      insures load balancing across different servers and high availability of
      the service. It also gives you the possibility to improve performance by
      simply adding more nodes to the cluster.
  - title: Monitoring and alerting
    description: >-
      Our microservice architecture based on Spark can achieve horizontal
      scalability to efficiently process large-scale of usage records. With a
      simple 3-node cluster, our architecture can process up to 3 000 usage
      records per second.

      Opencell provides built-in monitoring and alerting tools that allow
      detecting system errors, components’ status and performance. All relevant
      events are logged and accessible on the Opencell Portal.
