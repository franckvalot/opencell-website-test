      Opencell is “cloud-ready” and can be instantly deployed in a private or a
      public Cloud using Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. You can
      also chose to run Opencell on virtual machines for on-premises deployment
      or in a managed hosting environment

      Clustering allows Opencell to run on several parallel servers providing
      load balancing and high availability of the service. It also makes it easy
      to improve performance by simply adding more nodes to the cluster.

    description: >-
      Our microservices architecture based on Spark can achieve horizontal
      scalability to efficiently process large-scale of usage records. With a
      simple 3-node cluster, we can currently process up to 3 000 usage records
      per second.
