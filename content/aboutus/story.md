    Opencell was created in 2015 to leverage an open source telco billing
    project initiated in 2007 by David Meyer, its current CEO. 


    Our mission was to provide the first agile monetization platform capable of
    filling the gap between costly and complex vertical billing solutions used
    in the telco and utility industries and the rigid "one size fits all" SaaS
    solutions that cover only  the most basic requirements.


    Four years later, Opencell is now the leading open source monetization
    platform with over 40 successful implementations with major players in the
    telco, utility, mobility and retail sectors.
