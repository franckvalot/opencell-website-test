    Opencell was created in 2015 to leverage an open source telco billing
    project initiated in 2007 by David Meyer, its current CEO. The company
    wanted to provide the first agile monetization platform capable of filling
    the gap between costly and cumbersome vertical billing solutions used in the
    telco and utility industries and the simpler "one size fits all" SaaS
    solutions that only cover the most basic requirements.


    Four years later, Opencell is now the leading open source monetization
    platform and has over 40 successful implementations with major players in
    the telco, utility, mobility and retail sectors. It implements its platform
    either directly or through its extensive partner network.
